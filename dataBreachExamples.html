        <h1>Data Breach Examples</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Yahoo! suffered the most significant data breach in history between 2013 and 2014. Attackers gained unauthorized access to names, email addresses, passwords and security questions, affecting approximately 3 billion user accounts. The incident was not revealed until 2016—when Verizon was in talks to buy the tech giant. As a result of the data breach, Verizon lowered its original offer by $350 million and ended up buying Yahoo! at a reduced price of $4.48 billion.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>In 2017, Equifax—one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States—was hit by a data breach that affected approximately 147 million consumers. Attackers accessed Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, credit card numbers and driver’s licenses. In the aftermath, the company faced multiple lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and reputational damage, costing nearly $1.4 billion. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>The Marriott breach compromised the personal information of approximately 500 million guests who had reservations with the hotel giant’s Starwood brand. It exposed guests’ names, addresses, passport numbers, payment card details and other personal information. According to the New York Times, the attack was part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort seeking the personal data of American citizens. The company was subsequently fined over $23 million for failing to protect the information of its customers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>In 2021, hackers attacked Microsoft Exchange email servers and gained unauthorized access to the emails of as many as 60,000 companies worldwide. Once they broke into the servers, they could deploy malware, take charge of servers and gain access to other systems. (Forbes)
