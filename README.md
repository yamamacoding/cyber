WELCOME TO COHORT 6 GIVE BACK PROJECT

Our project is a Government Risk Assessment!!

Why:
We were inspired by the recent social security data leaks that happened recently and wondered if there is way to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. As technology advances and AI becomes more integral in everyday life, strengthening cybersecurity, especially for large entities like the US government, is increasingly crucial. The government holds critical information about every citizen, making even minor data leaks potentially dangerous. This project aims to evaluate the government's ability to maintain online privacy and identify any vulnerabilities in their systems. By understanding where the biggest risks lie, we can enhance protections for sensitive data, ensuring better compliance with data protection laws and safeguarding millions of individuals' personal information.

Goal:
The goals for this project is to run an analysis and assessemnt the government's current cybersecurity system and model and to see how it can be improved. We also will identify why do data breaches and leaks happen so often and what we can do to prevent them. The success of this project will be measured by a completed risk assessment document that states the current risk, what we can do to minimize it, and how much risk can be minimized.
