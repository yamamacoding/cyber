        <h1>Data Breaches: Risk and Impact</h1>
        <p>
            Data breaches can cause costly, time-consuming, and long-term damage whether you’re an individual, business or government organization. For businesses, data breaches can damage their reputation and destroy customers' trust, sometimes causing a lasting association with the incident. They can also have substantial effects on the bottom line from business loss, fines, settlements, and legal fees. Government organizations may experience ramifications from leaked military information, political strategy, and national data to foreign entities, posing a major cyberthreat to a government and citizens. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fraud is one of the most common cyberthreats for individual data breach victims, which could potentially ruin credit scores, pose legal and financial problems, and compromise your identity. From 2013-2016, a large American web services provider was the target of virtually the largest data breach on record. Hackers gained access to all 3 billion users’ names, birthdates, phone numbers, passwords, security questions and answers, and email addresses through a series of emails containing a link.
        </p>
        <p>
            The extent of the leak wasn’t public until the company was acquired, which resulted in a reduction in the purchase offer by $350 million.Hackers breached an American credit bureau in 2017, stealing the personal data of more than 147 million Americans. Today, it’s considered one of the largest cybercrimes related to identity theft.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cyberattackers gained access to the network before moving onto other servers to access personal information, including social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and credit card numbers. In the end, it cost the company $1.4 billion in fines and fees to repair the damage. The parent company of two large retail chains suffered a consumer data breach in 2007, which was considered the largest and most financially damaging breach in U.S. history at the time. Hackers accessed customer data by illegally accessing a store’s payment systems, making off with nearly 94 million compromised customer records and causing more than $256 million in financial loss.

        <h2>What can we do about it?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Develop an incident response plan: </strong> An incident response plan outlines the steps to contain the incident and minimize damage. It includes proper communication channels, containment procedures, forensic investigation processes and notification procedures to address the breach effectively. BitSight said businesses faced $2.66 million lower breach costs than organizations without an incident response team or plan. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Employee training and awareness:</strong> Educate employees about data security best practices, the risks of social engineering attacks and how to report potential security incidents. Host training programs and teach them how to avoid data leakage
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong>  Establish mechanisms to verify the identity of users seeking access to systems such as passwords, biometrics, two-factor authentication (2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA). Make sure employees have a level of access that matches their roles and responsibilities within the organization. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Update software</strong> Regularly update all software applications, operating systems and devices with the latest security patches and updates. Outdated software may have known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Data encryption:</strong> Encrypt sensitive data at rest (stored) and in transit (during transmission) to make it more difficult for unauthorized users to access and interpret the information if a breach occurs. (Forbes)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What do they target?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personally identifiable information (PII):</strong> Any information that represents the identity of a person, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, phone number, email address, and home address. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Protected health information (PHI):</strong> Electronic and paper records that identify a patient and their health status, history, and treatment. This may include demographic data, personal information, medical records, health insurance, and account numbers. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Intellectual property (IP):</strong> Intangible assets of human intellect, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchises, trade secrets, and digital assets. Examples include company logos, music, computer software, inventions, domain names, and literary works. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Financial and payment data:</strong> Any personal and financial information collected from payments, such as credit or debit card numbers, payment activity, individual transactions, and company-level data. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Business-critical data:</strong> Any information that is essential to the success of a business, including source code, business plans, merger and acquisition files, as well as data that must be kept for regulatory and compliance reasons. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Operational data:</strong> Data that is crucial to an organization’s day-to-day operations. This may include financial statements, legal documents, batch files, invoices, sales reports, and IT files. (Microsoft Security)
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why and How do they happen?</h2>
        <h4>Why:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weak Security Measures:</strong> Insufficient security measures, like weak passwords, lack of encryption or outdated software, can make systems vulnerable to attacks.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Human Error:</strong> Mistakes by employees, such as accidental disclosure of sensitive information, improper handling of data or falling victim to phishing scams, can lead to data breaches.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Hackers:</strong> Attackers may use ransomware, phishing attacks or targeted cyber attacks to gain unauthorized access to data. A common motivation among attackers is financial gain. They may seek to steal sensitive financial information, such as credit card details, bank account credentials or personal information, then sell them on the dark web or use them for fraudulent activities. Some hackers work for the government to gather intelligence and spy on rival nations. Others may seek to prove their skills and test their limits. (Forbes Advisior)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Hackers gather information and gather as much intelligence as possible about the target. They identify potential vulnerabilities, collect insights about the target systems or conduct phishing attacks to collect valuable data.   
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Attack:</strong> The attacker infiltrates the target organization’s systems or networks. They may use various methods, such as exploiting software vulnerabilities, conducting phishing attacks, cracking weak passwords and stealing login credentials. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Compromise Data:</strong> Once inside the compromised systems, the attacker may employ different techniques to obtain and extract valuable information. From there, the attacker may use the data for malicious purposes such as selling it on the dark web, committing identity theft, conducting financial fraud or exposing sensitive information that can damage individuals or organizations. (Forbes)
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Life Cycle of Data Breaches</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning:</strong> The lifecycle of a data breach originates with a cyberattacker that discovers a security weakness in the system, individual, or organization they intend to attack. Then they move on with determining the right strategy for the type of vulnerability.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Initial compromise:</strong> In a network-based cyberattack, they exploit weaknesses in their target’s infrastructure. In a social cyberattack, they send a malicious email or some other social engineering tactic to instigate a breach. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Lateral movement and privilege escalation:</strong> where the cyberattacker moves deeper into the network after initial access. Then, they use techniques to advance their privileges, known as privilege escalation, to achieve their goals. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Data exfiltration:</strong> involves intentional, unauthorized copying, transfer, or movement of data from a computer, device, app, service, or database. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Covering tracks:</strong> cyberattacker hides all evidence to avoid being discovered. This may involve disabling auditing features, clearing logs, or manipulating log files. (Microsoft Security)
