        <h1>What is a Data Breach?</h1>
        <p>
            A data breach occurs when unauthorized parties infiltrate computer systems, networks or databases to gain access to confidential information. Breached data can include personal information, financial records, intellectual property or any other protected information that falls into the wrong hands. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The consequences of a data breach can be severe such as financial losses, reputational damage, legal implications and potential harm to victims. This can include anyone from individual consumers to smaller businesses and even large multinational enterprises. Data breach and cyber attack are terms used 
            interchangeably—but they mean different things. In a data breach, the primary focus is unauthorized access to the data. For example, a hacker gains access to users’ names, Social Security numbers and passwords. (Forbes Advisor)
        </p>
        <p>
            A data breach is any security incident in which unauthorized parties access sensitive or confidential information, including personal data (Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, healthcare data) and corporate data (customer records, intellectual property, financial information).

        <h1>Types of Data Breaches</h1>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/what-is-phishing/">Phishing attacks</a> typically involve deceptive emails or messages that trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details or 
                login credentials. These attacks rely on social engineering techniques and exploit human trust and naivety. Malware encompasses a range of software-based attacks. It includes viruses, ransomware, spyware and trojans designed to infiltrate systems, steal data or disrupt operations.Insider threats involve individuals within an organization who misuse their access privileges to intentionally or inadvertently cause a data breach. Some examples are employees stealing or leaking sensitive information or falling victim to phishing attacks that inadvertently lead to unauthorized access to the data.

            <br>
            <li>
                Physical breaches occur when servers, computers or storage devices with sensitive information get stolen. It can happen through theft, unauthorized entry or improper equipment disposal without adequately erasing the data.Password Guessing: attackers gain unauthorized access to user accounts by attempting different combinations of passwords.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts files or blocks access to computer systems. When a device or network is infected, the victim’s files become inaccessible. The attacker then displays a ransom message that usually demands payment to restore the system.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Distributed denial of service (DDoS): aims to disrupt the computer network by overwhelming it with incoming traffic. By overcoming the network or server, the attacker disrupts the system’s capacity to respond to legitimate requests, leading it to slow down or even crash. The objective of a DDoS attack is not to gain unauthorized access or steal data but to make the targeted network unavailable to legitimate users. For example, an organization’s employees may need help signing in to the platform. (Forbes Advisor)

        <h1>Identifying and Responding to a Data Breach</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the type of data breach:</strong> A search for security vulnerabilities, a security breach of the general network, or a cyberattack notification are examples of leads. An indicator means a breach has 
                already occurred or is currently in action—often detected by suspicious emails or login security activity. A breach can also occur internally when departing employees commit data theft. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Employ immediate precautions:</strong> Record the date and time of identification. Then, the breach must be reported to internal parties, followed by access restrictions on the data.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Collect evidence:</strong> Speak with the individuals that identified the breach, check your cybersecurity tools, and assess data movements in your apps, services, servers, and devices. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Analyze the breach:</strong> Examine traffic, access, duration, software, data and people involved, and the type of breach. Take restriction, destruction, and recover precautions: Move quickly to restrict access to 
                servers and apps, prevent destruction of evidence, and initiate recovery of servers to their former states. Notify stakeholders and law enforcement about the breach.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Focus on protective measures:</strong> Study the breach to create new insights for preventing future breaches.
